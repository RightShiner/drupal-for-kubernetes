# Update Drupal core

Unless you're perpetually building new Drupal sites and deleting your old one after a day, you will need to upgrade Drupal from time to time, whether for new features or security or bug fixes.

Since we built the Drupal site's codebase using Composer, we should also use Composer to upgrade Drupal and any other dependencies (e.g. modules, base themes, etc.).

TODO.
